description: 2Doods is a puzzle game where the player must shift between a traditional 3D first-person perspective and a 2D perspective where the player is walking within the walls of the level, similar to a traditional platformer style of game. This idea opened a number of puzzles that we could create by creating certain elements that can only be completed in 3D and some only in 2D, as well as transferring objects between these two planes of interaction. This was inspired by the book series 'Flat Stanley' and Children's TV show 'Roy', both feature characters that have been 'flattened' and can do things such as slipping through gaps in door frames.<br><br>Documentation created for this project can be found for both <a href="/confluence_pages/2Doods/Pre-Production.html">Pre-Production</a> and <a href="/confluence_pages/2Doods/Production.html">Production</a>
