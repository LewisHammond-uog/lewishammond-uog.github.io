description: For this project I created a Boids Simulation using C++. Boids are an artifical life program which simulate the flocking behaviour of Bird-oid Objects.<br>Boids are an example of emergent behaviour, that is, e complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The simple rules that Boids adhear to are:<ul><li>Separation - <i>steer to avoid crowding local flockmates</i></li><li>Alignment - <i>steer towards the average heading of local flockmates</i></li><li>Cohesion - <i>steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates</i></li></ul><br>For my Project I created a simulation of the flocking of fish. In addition to the flocking behaviours the boids avoid dymanically placed collision objects. The collision detection is handled by the intergration of the ReactPhysics3D libary and rendering with OpenGL.<br><br>The project has been implemented to work as an ECS (Entity Component System) framework where the each element of an object is a seperate component (i.e Transform, BoidBrain, Raycast, Collider etc.) in the same way as most popular game engines do. 

summary: A Simulation of BOID (Bird-Like Objects) in C++ with OpenGL

contribution: As the solo programmer of the project I implemented all of the the features present in the simulation <br>Features Implemented:<ul><li>Intergration of 3rd Party Rendering Libaries (OpenGL, Glad, GLFW, DearIMGui)</li><li>Boid Steering Behavaiours (Seek, Flee)</li><li>Boid Flocking Behaviours (Seperation, Alignment, Cohesion)</li><li>Boid Spawning</li><li>Boid Collision Avoidance</li><li>Intergration of ReactPhysics3D</li><li>Boid Setting Menu</li><li>Entity Inspector</li><li>Entity Component System (ECS)</li></ul>
