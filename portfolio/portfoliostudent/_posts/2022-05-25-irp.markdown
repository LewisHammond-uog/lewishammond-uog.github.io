description: A practical implementation of Binary Space Partitioning, Diffusion Limited Aggregation and Dykstra Maps to create a procedurally generated dungeon. The application allows the tweaking of the dungeon bounds, cell size, corridors, number of iterations and DLA particle count. This was created as part of my Universtiy Independent Research Project, the report that preceded the creation of this implementation can be read at <a target="_blank" href="docs/DungeonGen/IRP.pdf">An Investigation into Methods for Procedural Dungeon Generation for Roguelike Games</a>

summary: A practical implementation of Binary Space Partitionin combined with other techniques to create a procedurally generated dungeon

contribution: I completed the entire implementation of this project, including the preceding report that informed my design desisions<br>Features Implemented:<ul><li>Binary Space Partitoning to divide cells and generate corridors</li><li>Diffusion Limited Aggregation to destroy room walls</li><li>Dykstra Maps to generate distance visualization</li><li>Dykstra Pathfinding for shortest route</li><li>Customiztion and Explaination UI</li></ul>
